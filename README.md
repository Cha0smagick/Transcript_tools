# Multi-Purpose Text and Audio Processing Toolkit
This GitHub repository contains a versatile toolkit for text and audio processing tasks, designed to streamline various tasks related to transcription, text optimization, and audio synthesis. The toolkit offers a user-friendly command-line interface with several key functionalities:

Audio-to-Text Transcription: Convert audio files (in WAV format) into text using Google's speech recognition service. The resulting transcriptions are saved in text files for easy access.

Text-to-Audio Conversion: Transform text files into audio files (in WAV format) using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). This feature supports multiple languages, including Spanish.

Semantic Optimization: Enhance the semantic quality of textual content through two distinct methods:
        ChatGPT Integration: Utilize ChatGPT, a powerful language model, to improve the coherence and fluency of provided text.
        Bard AI Integration: Employ Bard AI, a text correction and enhancement tool, to refine text and correct errors.

MP4-to-WAV Conversion: Convert MP4 video files into WAV audio files, allowing users to extract and manipulate audio from videos.

The toolkit is designed for flexibility and ease of use, making it suitable for various applications, from transcribing audio recordings to improving the quality of textual content. It incorporates external libraries, such as SpeechRecognition, gTTS, GPT-4, Bard API, and MoviePy, to provide comprehensive functionality.
